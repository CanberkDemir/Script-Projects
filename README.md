# Script-Projects
A repo to share little scripts I made for my personal use. Feel free to use them.

# 1st Project
## Script to edit the metadata and cover art of a mp3 file
I'm pretty sure this has been done before, but it was a fun project to learn bash.
Acts as a semi command line tool, which the functions are binded to the first position of the script

**Functions**
- Can edit the metadata of a mp3 file:
  - Song Title
  - Artist
  - Album title
  - Genre
  - Year
- Can change the album art cover using a png or jpeg image file

The function list can be expandable within ffmpegs capabilities
